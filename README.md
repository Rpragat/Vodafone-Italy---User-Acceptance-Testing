# Amdocs Multimillion Dollar Client
# Vodafone-Italy - User-Acceptance-Testing at Client Site (Milan, Italy)
This project involved User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for Vodafone Italy, focusing on validating new features and system integrations prior to production release. As a control room lead of the self service and retail channel, I collaborated with developers, business analysts, and end-users to ensure the solutions met Vodafone’s quality standards and business requirements.

# Background
Vodafone Italy is at the forefront of telecom innovation in Europe, with large-scale deployments in 5G, IoT, and digital services. With frequent updates and integrations across mobile, fixed, and IoT platforms, rigorous UAT is critical to maintain service quality for its customers. The Customer base of vodafone italy is 17.2 Million in Europe. It shares 29% of telecom market share. 

# Objectives
  
- Validate new features and integrations against business requirements.

- Ensure seamless customer experience across Vodafone’s digital platforms.

- Identify and document defects for timely resolution before go-live.

- Support Vodafone’s commitment to high-quality, reliable telecom services.

- Create Test Plan

- Support Testing in Italian Language 

# Methodology

 - Test Automation: Leveraged automated testing frameworks integrated into Vodafone’s CI/CD pipeline for regression and performance testing.

- Manual Testing: Conducted exploratory and scenario-based testing for complex user workflows.

- Collaboration: Worked in cross-functional teams, using JIRA for defect tracking and Agile methodologies for iterative feedback.

- Continuous Integration: Automated tests were triggered with each code commit, enabling rapid feedback and reducing manual effort.

 # Technologies Used

Test Tools: Selenium, Postman

CI/CD: Jenkins, GitLab CI

Defect Tracking: JIRA

Collaboration: Confluence

# Results & Metrics

Defects Identified : 

- 45 critical/major defects detected and resolved during UAT.

- Test Coverage: Achieved 95% test coverage for core user journeys.

- Go-Live Success: Zero critical issues reported post-production launch.

- Process Improvement: Recommendations led to enhanced test case design and faster defect resolution cycles.

# Challenges

- Complex Integrations: Testing across mobile, fiber, and IoT platforms required robust test environments and careful coordination.

- Device Diversity: Ensured compatibility across a wide range of devices and network configurations.

# Lessons Learned

- Automation is Key: Automated regression suites significantly reduced manual effort and improved release confidence.

- Stakeholder Engagement: Close collaboration with business users ensured tests reflected real-world scenarios.

- Continuous Learning: Staying updated with Vodafone’s evolving tech stack (5G, IoT) was essential for effective testing.

- Created a grasp on Italian language to provide best of quality standards for the project
