# Vodafone-Italy---User-Acceptance-Testing
This project involved User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for Vodafone Italy, focusing on validating new features and system integrations prior to production release. As a control room lead of the self service and retail channel, I collaborated with developers, business analysts, and end-users to ensure the solutions met Vodafoneâ€™s quality standards and business requirements.
